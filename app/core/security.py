"""JWT authentication against the GANJJ `authorization` service.

Every request into this service must carry a valid access token, issued by
`authorization` and signed with RS256. Verification happens entirely locally
against the issuer's public key, fetched once at startup - there is no
per-request call to `authorization`. See
`authorization/docs/COMO-FUNCIONA.md` (in the authorization repo) for the
full rationale behind this design.
